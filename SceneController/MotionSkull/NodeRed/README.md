# Motion Skull Look Left or Right using Node-Red
This scene controller is going to be used for my Halloween display.  I decided to implement this scene controller using [Node-Red](http://nodered.org/) on a Raspberry Pi.  The goal of this controller is to have the skull bow his head when no motion exists but if motion is detected on the right or the left then the head turns toward the motion and lets out a laugh.
