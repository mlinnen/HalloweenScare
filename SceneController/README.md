# Scene Controller
The idea for this device is to provide the brains behind listening to sensor data and making decisions on what should happen to a scene.  There really isn't any specifications for this device as it is really about tying the devices together into a workflow.   

## Motion triggers next video
This is a pretty simple scene controller.  It basically listens for motion sensor data adn when motion is detected it will command a media player to play the next video in a sequence.
